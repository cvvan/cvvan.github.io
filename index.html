<h2>POPURRI</h2> <br/>
<h3>-An odd yet appealing mix-</h3></div>

<div id ="top"class="container sass">
Popurri is the spanish word for pot pourri<br/>
normally it's associated with music<br/>
a popurri made out of the best songs from the season was a <br/> normal ocurrence three to four generations ago in Latinamerica.<br/>
But it also refers to any kind of mix, specially messy ones.<br/>This website is a Popurri constructed out of many different interests.
 <br/>
I hope you will find the same appeal I did.<br/>

<p class="text"> Many people describe passion as enthusiasm 
that ignites one's soul.<br/> I would rather classify it between obssesions and other pathias.<br/>
This website is a stand-alone project that began being developed in August from 2017. <br/>
Its purpose lie on a wide range of interests, which were either catalyst for its creation or, due 
to its birth, found a place for exposure.<br/>
Art, Design, and Programming <br/>
A learning experience but also a showcase for my work<br/>
As means of learning, I'd kindly appreciate any form of criticism that could be made in regards to
the basic programming of this page as well to anatomical concerns that may arise from the gallery side.
